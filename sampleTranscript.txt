In this video,
0:01
I will explain the types of discontinuity a function may have,
0:04
and how some of them can be “removed”.
Failing continuity
0:08
How may a function fail to be continuous? Let’s remember the definition.
0:12
We say that a function f is continuous at a point a
0:16
when the limit at a is the same as the value f(a).
0:20
Otherwise, we say that the function is discontinuous.
0:23
It is traditional
0:24
to classify discontinuities as removable, and non-removable.
0:28
We have a removable discontinuity when the limit EXISTS
0:32
but the limit is NOT equal to the value of the function f at a.
0:36
And we have a non-removable discontinuity
0:38
when the limit of the function does NOT exist.
0:41
I will explain why this classification is useful,
0:43
and the reason for the name.
Removable discontinuities
0:46
Here is an example of a removable discontinuity.
0:49
The limit as x approaches a EXISTS, but it is NOT equal to f(a).
0:53
In this case, the graph has a HOLE.
0:56
It does not matter if the function is UNdefined at a,
0:59
or if it is defined but with a different value.
1:02
In both cases, the graph HAS a hole,
1:04
and both cases count as a removable discontinuity.
1:07
Why is it called removable?
1:09
Because it can be “fixed.” I will explain with an example.
1:14
Consider the function h, defined by the equation h(x) = sin(x)/x.
1:20
As x approaches 0,
1:21
this function HAS limit 1, but h(0) IS UNdefined.
1:26
This is what the graph looks like.
1:28
If this is the first time you are encountering this function,
1:30
you may be surprised; it is not obvious that this limit is 1.
1:33
For now, just accept that this is the case from the graph;
1:36
I will prove it in another video.
1:38
So the graph has a hole, and the function has a discontinuity.
1:42
But I can remove it by “filling" the hole!
1:45
What does this mean?
1:47
I am going to define a new function, called H ("big H").
1:50
H is exactly the same as the original function when x is not 0.
1:54
But in addition, I am going to define H(0) to be 1.
1:59
When I do this, H becomes CONTINUOUS at 0.
2:04
Think about the graph!
2:05
THIS is the graph of the original function, h ("small h"),
2:08
with the hole at 0.
2:10
The new function H is exactly the same, except it is also defined to be 1 at 0.
2:15
So the new function "fills the hole," so to speak, and THIS is the graph.
2:20
I am exaggerating a bit how I fill the whole to make it clear;
2:22
I probably could simply draw the graph like this.
2:27
What I did here, “removing” the discontinuity,
2:30
is something we can ALWAYS do as long as the limit exists.
2:33
And that is why we call it a “removable” discontinuity.
2:37
In a way, it is as though we had a continuous function,
2:39
but we forgot to define it at the point, or we defined it with the "wrong" value.
2:43
In science, and more particularly in physics,
2:45
it is common to remove discontinuities automatically whenever possible.
2:49
Physicists normally DON'T make any distinction
2:51
between a function with a removable discontinuity,
2:54
and the same function with the discontinuity removed.
2:57
For example, if a physicist talks about sin(x)/x,
3:00
they are probably thinking about H; about the "fixed" function.
Non-removable discontinuities
3:05
By contrast, let’s look at some examples of NON-removable discontinuities.
3:11
This function does NOT have a limit at 0, because it has a JUMP.
3:15
It is a non-removable discontinuity;
3:18
try as we may, we cannot “fix” this function;
3:20
we cannot make it continuous by redefining it at 0.
3:24
This other function does NOT have a limit at 1,
3:27
because it has a VERTICAL ASYMPTOTE at 1.
3:30
It CANNOT be "fixed," either;
3:31
it CANNOT be made continuous by defining it at 1.
3:35
It ALSO has a non-removable discontinuity.
3:39
And this final example does not have a limit at 0, either.
3:42
It ALSO has a non-removable discontinuity;
3:44
there is no way to fix it.
3:46
In short, removable discontinuities can be...
3:49
well, removed!
3:51
Non-removable discontinuities CANNOT. THAT is the reason for the name.
